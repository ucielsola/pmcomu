### About the project
My first job as a **web Developer** was at **PM Comunicaciones**. We've been offering WordPress websites and community management services since 2020.

I have moved on from WordPress when building landing pages or statics sites that doesn't need a backend, and started using **Svelte** and **Sveltekit** (mainly) to create **ultra-fast** and **super-light** websites.

So, some specs:
- SSR 
- Hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.app)
- Built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)
- Forms submissions handled with [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/)

Want to test it locally? Just **clone** the repo, **run** _npm i_ inside the project's directory, and then **run** _npm run dev_.
